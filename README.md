# Ardupilot Companion
The aim of this project is to setup a remote link to a Linux Ardupilot companion machine.
The link is expected to share the MAVlink channel from the ardupilot instance and make it reachable from the Internet.

# Setup guidelines
Clone the repository and its dependencies using the following command:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ansaya/ardupilot-companion.git
```

Launch scripts as needed.

More guidelines to come, still work in progress.
